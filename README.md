## Usage

1. Add a game with the **+** icon in the top left.
2. It should auto-detect your install path and Proton prefix, but you can change these if needed.
3. Change the staging directory if you wish — this is where your mods are stored.
4. Use the **Install Mod** button to install a new mod.  
   Optionally, you can install from the Downloads tab if the mod is in your downloads folder.
5. Sort your mods in the mod list panel. You can add separators to group them.
6. If using a LOOT-supported game, you can sort and move plugins in the Plugins tab.
7. Click **Deploy** to move the mods to the game folder, or **Restore** to undo this.
8. Run the game via your normal method, Steam/Heroic/Lutris. You can also run the game in the top right with the run exe button.

You can also add multiple profiles with different configurations — simply create/swap to that profile and deploy it.

## Supporting Applications

The manager supports many supporting applications used to mod games. Place the applications in the games applications folder (**In the staging folder**) and they will be auto detected. The arguments/config used to run them will be auto-generated to make setup easier.

| Status | Application | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Working | **Pandora Behaviour Engine** | `--tesv:` and `--output:` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **SSEEdit** | `-d` and `-o` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **pgpatcher** | Requires `d3dcompiler_47` installed to the game prefix via Protontricks. Config auto generated to include Data directory and output folder |
| Working | **DynDOLOD** | `-d` and `-o` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **TexGen** | `-d` and `-o` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **xLodGen** | `-d` and `-o` args. Game argument appended at runtime |
| Working | **Bethini Pie** | Just works |
| Experimental | **Vramr** | Experimental python wrapper See below for instructions|
| Experimental | **Bendr** | Experimental python wrapper See below for instructions|
| Experimental | **ParallaxR** | Experimental python wrapper See below for instructions|
| Working | **Wrye Bash** | `-o` Auto generated for selected game at runtime |
| Working | **Synthesis** | Requires .net10 sdk and .net5 runtime installed into the prefix (Use the proton tools window to do this) |
| Working | **Bodyslide and Outfits Studio** | Add as a mod > Deploy > refresh the exe list > Run the exe and it should work |
| Working | **Witcher 3 Script merger** | Game path added to config automatically |

The other xedit applications for the other games also work as well as the quickautoclean applications.

## Running Windows Apps (e.g. SSEEdit)

1. Add the folder containing the exe to Applications folder in the game's staging path.
2. Hit **Refresh** on the top right.
3. You can configure the exe to change the arguments or the output mod/folder.
4. Make sure your game is deployed before running so the application gets the right files.
5. Hit **Run exe** — it will run using the Proton version and prefix the game uses.
## Needs Testing

As this application is fairly new, the following needs testing:

- Support on multiple Linux distros
- Verification that all added games work
- Baulders Gate 3 testing - The Mod manager can build modsettings.lsx but further testing is needed to know if it's working fully
- Oblivion Remastered - Uses a special ue5 handler that auto sorts mods into the correct locations. Some mods could be applied incorrectly. from a test of 10-20 mods only 1 caused trouble but was easily fixed with the set deployment paths right click option

## VRAMr + BENDr + ParallaxR

The following applications were tested and run in Ge-proton 10, It is recommended to have ge-proton 10 installed for these to work. These are very experimental and may not work as expected.

VRAMr (Version 15.0723) works by using an experimental python wrapper. The optimisation step is also changed to use compressonator which is faster with native Linux support vs running texconv through Wine/Proton

BENDr (Version 2.21) Uses a similar process

ParallaxR (Version 2.0) Uses a similar process, Requires a patched ucrtbase.dll (This one can be quite slow, Not much I can do about that)

> Why is ucrtbase.dll included? Wine is missing implementations for a few C99 math functions (crealf, cimagf, etc.) that HeightMap.exe requires. This is a copy of Wine's own ucrtbase.dll with those ~4 stub functions patched to work correctly.

**Any issues with this should be reported here and not to the VRAMr devs, This is experimental and not an offical Linux release**

- Place the Vramr/Bendr/ParallaxR folder in Skyrim Special Edition/Applications/ in the games staging folder
- In Amethyst mod manager, run VRAMr.bat/BENDr.bat/ParallaxR.bat **Make sure your modlist is deployed first**
- It will run the wrapper script, Progress will be added to the log, A temporary wine prefix will be created in the home directory
- Output will be placed as a mod in a VRAMr/BENDr/ParallaxR folder. Refresh the modlist and enable it. Delete it if you want to do another run but remember to deploy before you do so.

## Planned Features

- Adding/Installing collections directly into the manager as a new profile, This would be for Nexus premium users only but the manager would handle the installation of collections and add them as separate profiles you can switch between to deploy. This will require the application to be Registered with Nexus first but the frameworks to allow this feature to work already exist and shouldn't be too hard to implement.
