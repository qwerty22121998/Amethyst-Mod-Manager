## Usage

1. Add a game with the **+** icon in the top left.
2. It should auto-detect your install path and Proton prefix, but you can change these if needed.
3. Change the staging directory if you wish — this is where your mods are stored.
4. Use the **Install Mod** button to install a new mod.  
   Optionally, you can install from the Downloads tab if the mod is in your downloads folder.
5. Sort your mods in the mod list panel. You can add separators to group them.
6. If using a LOOT-supported game, you can sort and move plugins in the Plugins tab.
7. Click **Deploy** to move the mods to the game folder, or **Restore** to undo this.
8. Run the game via your normal method, Steam/Heroic/Lutris. You can also run the game in the top right with the run exe button.

You can also add multiple profiles with different configurations — simply create/swap to that profile and deploy it.

## Collections

The manager has the ability to add Nexus collections straight into the manager. Here's how it works:
- This feature only works for nexus premium users, There's no mechanism currently to manually download the mods.
- The collections page will show the top collections for the selected game, A url can be entered to a specific collection instead.
- When installing a collection they are downloaded in size order largest first
- They are then installed, also in size order, smallest first. The application may "freeze" while extracting large zip files. This is normal
- Some mods come with fomod settings, meaning the fomod menu is skipped for some mods. Some others will still pop up and need manual input.
- The authors load order is applied when the collection completes
- Collections are installed as separate profiles and can be switched between, letting you easily swap modlists.
- There are some limitations, Not all collections will work fully due to missing mods or our game handlers coming across a mod that has been shipped/packaged in an unusual fashion. Some may require some manual intervention to get to work.


## Supporting Applications

The manager supports many supporting applications used to mod games. Place the applications in the games applications folder (**In the staging folder**) and they will be auto detected. The arguments/config used to run them will be auto-generated to make setup easier.

| Working | **Pandora Behaviour Engine** | `--tesv:` and `--output:` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **SSEEdit** | `-d` and `-o` args applied at runtime|

| Working | **TexGen** | `-d` and `-o` args applied at runtime|
| Working | **xLodGen** | `-d` and `-o` args. Game argument appended at runtime |
