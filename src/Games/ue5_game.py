"""
ue5_game.py
Abstract base class for Unreal Engine 5 games.

UE5 games ship mods as files destined for multiple locations inside the game
root (pak files → Content/Paks/, esp/esm plugins → Content/Dev/ObvData/Data/,
UE4SS lua mods → Binaries/Win64/ue4ss/Mods/, etc.).

This base class handles the multi-target deploy/restore pattern.  Subclasses
declare their routing rules via ``ue5_routing_rules`` and fill in the usual
identity/path properties.

Routing rules
-------------
Each rule is a dict with at least:
  ``dest``  — path relative to game root where matching files are deployed
              (e.g. ``"Content/Paks"``)

Match criteria (one or more):
  ``extensions``  — list of lowercase dotted extensions, e.g. ``[".pak", ".utoc"]``
  ``folder``      — top-level folder name inside the mod (case-insensitive),
                    e.g. ``"ue4ss"`` — matches when the first path segment of
                    the staged file equals this string
  ``strip``       — optional list of leading path segments to strip from the
                    staged relative path before writing to ``dest``
                    (e.g. strip ``["Content/Paks", "Paks"]`` so a staged file at
                    ``Content/Paks/MyMod.pak`` deploys as ``Content/Paks/MyMod.pak``
                    rather than ``Content/Paks/Content/Paks/MyMod.pak``)

Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins.  Files that match no rule
are deployed to ``ue5_default_dest`` (defaults to the game root itself).

Deploy workflow
---------------
Unlike traditional games, UE5 mod destinations are not folders full of vanilla
files — they are either empty or contain unrelated game content that must not
be touched.  Deploy therefore works without a Core backup:

  1. Place each mod file directly into its resolved game destination.
  2. Track every placed file path in a deployed.txt manifest.

Restore:
  1. Read deployed.txt and delete every listed file.
  2. Remove any directories that became empty.
  3. Delete deployed.txt.

class UE5Rule:
    """A single file-routing rule for a UE5 game.

    Attributes:
        dest:       Game-root-relative destination directory.
        extensions: Match files with these lowercase extensions (e.g. ".pak").
        folder:     Match files whose first staged path segment equals this
                    value (case-insensitive), e.g. "ue4ss".
        folder_anywhere:
                    Match files where this folder name appears as any path
                    segment (case-insensitive), not just the first one. The
                    prefix above the matched segment is stripped automatically.
                    Used by user-defined custom rules so a folder rule like
                    "folder2" matches "Binaries/Win64/folder1/folder2/file"
                    and lands at "<dest>/folder2/file".
        prefix:     Match files whose staged path starts with this multi-segment
                    prefix (case-insensitive), e.g. "Binaries/Win64/ue4ss".
                    More specific than ``folder`` — checked first.
        filenames:  Match files whose basename (case-insensitive) is in this
                    list, e.g. ["enabled.txt"].  Checked after prefix/folder.
        strip:      Path prefixes to strip from the staged relative path
                    before placing the file inside ``dest``.
                    Checked longest-first so more-specific prefixes win.
    flatten:    When True, reduce the final path to just the filename,
                    discarding all directory components.  Useful for files
                    that must land flat in ``dest`` regardless of how they
                    are packaged inside the mod folder (e.g. .bk2 movies).
    loose_only: When True, the rule only matches files that are not inside
                    any folder (i.e. files with no directory components in
                    their relative path).  Default False.
