"""
filemap.py
Build and write a filemap.txt that resolves mod file conflicts.

Algorithm: walk enabled mods from lowest priority to highest priority.
For each file, record (relative_path, source_mod). Higher-priority mods
overwrite lower-priority entries — no conflicts remain in the output.

Format (one line per file):
    <relative/path/to/file>\t<mod_name>

Paths are stored in their original case but deduplicated case-insensitively
so that Windows-style case-insensitive conflicts are handled correctly.

Mod Index
---------
modindex.bin lives next to filemap.txt and caches the file list of every
mod so that build_filemap() can skip the expensive disk scan on every
enable/disable/reorder.  The index is only updated when mods are installed
or removed (or when the user hits the Refresh button).

Index format — msgpack binary, v4:
    {"v": 4, "mods": [[mod_name, [[rel_key, rel_str, kind], ...]], ...]}
where <kind> is "n" (normal) or "r" (unused legacy, kept for format compatibility).
Paths stored in the index reflect the raw on-disk casing of each mod's files.
build_filemap() normalizes folder-case across mods when assembling the merged
filemap output, but the index itself stays a faithful mirror of disk so that
deploy can construct correct source paths regardless of cross-mod casing.

    Pure function — no shared state, safe to call from any thread.

    strip_path_prefixes — full path prefixes to strip once (e.g. ["Tree", "Meshes/Architecture"]).
    Applied first, before strip_prefixes. Longest match wins. Case-insensitive.

    strip_prefixes — lowercase top-level folder names to remove from the

    allowed_extensions — when non-empty, only files whose lowercase extension
    (including the leading dot) appears in this set are included.  e.g.
    allowed_extensions={".pak"} drops all non-.pak files from the result.

    exclude_dirs — lowercase directory names to skip entirely during the walk.
    Any directory whose name (case-insensitive) matches an entry here is never
