"""
atomic_write.py
Shared `.tmp` → rename helpers used wherever we write a file that must never
be observed half-written (filemap index, profile state, deploy snapshot, …).

Two shapes:

- ``write_atomic`` / ``write_atomic_text`` — caller hands over the full
  payload as bytes or text. Best when the payload is built in memory.
- ``atomic_writer`` — context manager that yields an open temp file. Best
  when the payload is streamed (e.g. walking a directory, writing line by
  line) so we don't have to buffer the whole thing first.

All three create the parent directory, write to ``<path>.tmp`` (or a custom
suffix), and atomically ``rename`` over the destination on success. On
failure, the partial temp file is removed so retries see a clean slate.
