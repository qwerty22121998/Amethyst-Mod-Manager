"""Register Bethesda game install paths in a Proton prefix.

Bethesda tools locate the game by reading ``Bethesda Softworks\\<Game>\\
Installed Path``. 32-bit tools (xEdit, LOOT, Synthesis, Wrye Bash) read it
under ``HKLM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\...``; 64-bit tools (BodySlide x64,
Outfit Studio x64) read the plain ``HKLM\\Software\\...`` view. Wine does
not mirror writes between the two views, so we write both.

Steam itself writes the 64-bit key when the user launches the game through
Steam — but users who install the game and immediately use a mod-manager
wizard never trigger that, leaving the key absent. Per-exe prefixes
(xEdit/Synthesis launched in their own compat folder) never have it at
all. Registering ourselves covers both cases.
