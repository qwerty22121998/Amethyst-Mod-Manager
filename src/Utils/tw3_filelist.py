"""
tw3_filelist.py — Menu Filelist Updater for The Witcher 3: Next-Gen Edition.

The Next-Gen update (4.0+) requires two text files in:
    bin/config/r4game/user_config_matrix/pc/

    dx11filelist.txt  — menu XMLs for DX11 mode
    dx12filelist.txt  — menu XMLs for DX12 mode

Each file is a plain list of XML filenames, one per line, each followed by
a semicolon:
    audio.xml;
    modSomeMenu.xml;
    graphicsdx11.xml;   ← DX11 only (excluded from DX12 list)
    graphics.xml;       ← DX12 only (excluded from DX11 list)

This module reimplements the logic of https://github.com/Aelto/tw3-menufilelist-updater
in pure Python so no external binary is needed.

Behaviour
---------
- If the target directory does not exist the function returns immediately
  (older game versions don't have it; they don't need filelists).
- If neither dx11filelist.txt nor dx12filelist.txt is present the function
  also returns immediately — the directory exists but the game version
  pre-dates the requirement, so we leave it alone.
- Filenames starting with "~" are ignored (backups/temporaries).
- The two vanilla graphics entries are swapped between the two lists as
  described above.
- Both output files are written atomically (via a .tmp sibling) so a crash
  mid-write cannot corrupt them.
- Returns a short human-readable summary string for callers to log.
